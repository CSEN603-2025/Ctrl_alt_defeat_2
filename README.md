# 🎓 GUC Internship System – React Prototype

This repository contains the front-end prototype for the **GUC Internship System**, developed as part of the Software Engineering course at the German University in Cairo (Spring 2025).

The project is built using **React** and **JavaScript**, and simulates a digital platform that manages the end-to-end process of internship application, review, and evaluation — all through an intuitive user interface.  
This system is designed for students, faculty members, companies, and the SCAD office.

> **Note:** This is a **front-end only prototype**, built without a backend or database. Dummy data is used to simulate functionality.

- Submission of student internship reports and company evaluations
- Review and validation by SCAD
